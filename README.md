This repository contains an example of a common error in recursive functions: forgetting to handle the base case properly. The `factorial` function calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer. However, if a negative integer is passed as an argument, the function will recurse infinitely until it hits the maximum recursion depth allowed by Python and causes a `RecursionError`. The solution demonstrates how to handle the base case of negative input to prevent this error.
